# RE: Invent
`Re:Invent` is a project to implement simple stl lib. Recently I read `the annotated STL Sources` and find I can not remember that code. So I open this project to rewrite some code and also learn stl,Generic Programming and algorithm.

As a github project, we can not forgot to add CI jobs. So, I choose `Catch` as my testing this.

I don't know how long I can do this work, but I will try my best to do it.


## About name
just inspired by `Re0` and `Re:Recreate`
